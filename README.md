# Flight-Fare-Prediction

## Prequisites:
----
- Python 
- sklearn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn


## Project Description:
----
The Airline Flight Fare Prediction  project is to predict airline flight fares across the Indian cities. The dataset for the project is taken from Kaggle, and it is a time-stamped dataset, so while building the model, extensive pre-processing was done on the dataset to finally come up with a ML model which could effectively predict airline fares across various Indian Cities.


## Dataset Features:
----

- Airline: The name of the airline.

- Date_of_Journey: The date of the journey

- Source: The source from which the service begins.

- Destination: The destination where the service ends.

- Route: The route taken by the flight to reach the destination.

- Dep_Time: The time when the journey starts from the source.

- Arrival_Time: Time of arrival at the destination.

- Duration: Total duration of the flight.

- Total_Stops: Total stops between the source and destination.

- Additional_Info: Additional information about the flight

- Price: The price of the ticket

## Challenges:
----

- EDA
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering

## Future Scope:
----
- Building a Flask web app
- Deploying our model on Heroku
